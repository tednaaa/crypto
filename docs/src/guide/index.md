5. **Regulation is evolving** - Rules change, sometimes overnight
6. **Scams are everywhere** - If it sounds too good to be true, it is

## 💡 Core Principles from 15+ Years

### The 80/20 Rule

- 80% of success comes from risk management and psychology
- 20% comes from technical analysis and strategy
- Most traders focus on the wrong 20%

### The Reality of Trading

- **Year 1:** You will likely lose money. Consider it tuition.
- **Year 2-3:** You might break even. This is actually great progress.
- **Year 4+:** Consistent profitability becomes possible with discipline.

### What Actually Matters

1. **Position sizing** - More important than entry price
2. **Risk management** - More important than being right
3. **Consistency** - More important than big wins
4. **Patience** - More important than activity
5. **Survival** - More important than profits

✅ Reality: All indicators lag; edge comes from application

❌ "More trades = more profits"
✅ Reality: Quality over quantity; overtrading kills accounts
