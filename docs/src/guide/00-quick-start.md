## 🛡️ The 10 Commandments (Never Break These)

### Risk Management Rules

1. **Never risk more than 2% per trade**
   - Calculate position size properly
   - Use a calculator, not guessing
   - This is your lifeline

2. **Always use stop losses**
   - Set immediately after entry
   - Never move further away
   - No exceptions

3. **Maximum 6-10% total portfolio risk**
   - Sum of all open position risks
   - Don't overconcentrate

4. **Stop trading at 20% drawdown**
   - Take mandatory 2-4 week break
   - Deep review required
   - Restart like beginner

5. **Never trade with leverage as beginner**
   - First year: 0× (spot only)
   - Leverage destroys accounts
   - Not even "just 2×"

### Psychological Rules

6. **After 2 losses, stop for 2+ hours**
   - Prevents revenge trading
   - Walk away from computer
   - Emotions need to reset

7. **Only trade your plan**
   - If not in your system, don't trade it
   - FOMO = account killer
   - Wait for your setup

8. **Journal every trade**
   - No journal = trade didn't happen
   - Track emotional state
   - Review weekly

9. **Don't trade when emotional**
   - Angry, scared, euphoric = NO TRADING
   - Take break until calm
   - Your brain is compromised

10. **Protect capital above all else**
    - Making money is secondary
    - Not losing money is primary
    - You can't trade without capital

## 📊 Simple Starting Strategy (For Beginners)

### Support/Resistance Bounce Strategy

**Why this one first:**

- Simple to understand
- Works in all markets
- High win rate (55-65%)
- Teaches fundamentals
- Low stress

**The Rules:**

#### Entry (LONG)

1. Identify clear support level (price bounced 3+ times)
2. Price approaches support zone
3. Bullish candlestick forms (hammer, engulfing)
4. RSI < 40 (oversold)
5. Next candle closes above signal candle
6. **ENTER**

#### Position Sizing

```
Account: $10,000
Risk: 2% = $200
Entry: $2,000
Stop: $1,950 (below support)
Distance: $50

Coins to buy: $200 ÷ $50 = 4 coins
Position value: 4 × $2,000 = $8,000
```

#### Stop Loss

- Place 2-3% below support level
- Account for volatility
- Set immediately, don't move

#### Take Profit

- Target: Next resistance level
- Minimum 1:2 risk/reward
- Sell 50% at target
- Trail stop on remaining 50%

#### Exit

- Stop loss hit → Accept loss, move on
- Target hit → Take profits
- Setup invalidated → Exit immediately

**Practice this strategy 50 times before trying others.**

## 📈 Essential Metrics to Track

### Don't Just Track Profit/Loss

**Track These:**

1. **Win Rate:** **\_**%
   - (Winning trades ÷ Total trades) × 100
   - 40-60% is normal
   - Lower is fine with good R/R

2. **Average Win:** $**\_**
   - Total profit ÷ Winning trades
   - Should be 2-3× average loss

3. **Average Loss:** $**\_**
   - Total losses ÷ Losing trades
   - Keep this small and consistent

4. **Profit Factor:** **\_**
   - Total wins ÷ Total losses
   - Need 1.5+ to be profitable

5. **Risk/Reward Ratio:** **\_**
   - Average win ÷ Average loss
   - Aim for 2:1 minimum

6. **Maximum Drawdown:** **\_**%
   - Largest peak-to-trough decline
   - If > 20%, stop trading

7. **Rule Adherence:** **\_**%
   - % of trades following your plan
   - More important than win rate
   - Aim for 80%+

**Review these weekly, not daily.**

## 🧠 Psychology Quick Reference

### Recognize These Emotional States

**STOP TRADING if you feel:**

❌ **Revenge** - "I'll get that money back NOW"
❌ **FOMO** - "I NEED to get in before it's too late"

❌ **Desperation** - "I need this trade to work"
❌ **Anger** - "This market is rigged against me"
❌ **Overconfidence** - "I don't need my rules anymore"

**Only trade when:**
✅ **Calm** - "This is just another trade"
✅ **Patient** - "I'll wait for my setup"
✅ **Detached** - "Outcome doesn't define me"
✅ **Disciplined** - "I follow my rules"

### The 5-Minute Rule

**Before any trade:**

1. Feel urge to trade
2. Set timer for 5 minutes
3. Walk away from computer
4. When timer rings, reassess

## 💡 Quick Tips from Experience

### What I Wish I Knew Year 1

1. **Smaller is better**
   - Start smaller than you think
   - Scale slower than you want
   - Survival > profits early on

2. **Boring = profitable**
   - Exciting trades lose money
   - Routine trades make money
   - If it feels good, probably wrong

3. **Wait more, trade less**
   - Best trades are obvious
   - Forced trades lose money
   - Patience is your edge

4. **Losses are business expenses**
   - Accept them gracefully
   - Learn and move on
   - No revenge trading

5. **Track everything**
   - Journal every trade
   - Patterns emerge over time
   - Can't improve what you don't measure

6. **Markets always here tomorrow**
   - Missing one trade is fine
   - Thousands more opportunities
   - Capital preservation = priority

7. **No one knows the future**
   - "Experts" are often wrong

   - Don't compare yourself
   - Most are faking it

9. **Simple systems work best**
   - Complexity ≠ better
   - Master the basics
   - Add complexity only if needed

10. **Psychology matters most**
    - Smartest traders aren't richest
