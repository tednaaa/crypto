# Getting Started with Crypto Trading

> **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks to complete this foundation
> **Investment:** Start with $0 (learn first, trade later)

## Introduction

Welcome to crypto trading. If you're reading this, you're either excited about the potential profits or you've already lost money and want to understand why. Both are valid starting points.

Let me be direct: **Most people who start trading crypto lose money.** Not because crypto is a scam, but because they skip the fundamentals, over-leverage, and let emotions drive decisions.

This guide will help you avoid those mistakes.

## What is Crypto Trading?

Crypto trading is the act of buying and selling cryptocurrencies to profit from price movements. Unlike traditional investing (buy and hold for years), trading involves:

- **Shorter timeframes** - Minutes to months, not years
- **Active management** - Regular monitoring and decisions
- **Technical analysis** - Charts, patterns, indicators
- **Higher risk** - More volatility = more opportunity AND danger

### Types of Crypto Trading

1. **Day Trading**
   - Buy and sell within the same day
   - Requires full-time attention
   - High stress, high time commitment
   - **Not recommended for beginners**

2. **Swing Trading**
   - Hold positions for days to weeks
   - Captures medium-term trends
   - More manageable for part-time traders
   - **Recommended starting point**

3. **Position Trading**
   - Hold for weeks to months
   - Based on longer-term trends
   - Less time intensive
   - **Also good for beginners**

4. **Scalping**
   - Dozens of trades per day
   - Profits from tiny price movements
   - Extremely demanding
   - **Avoid until you're consistently profitable**

5. **HODLing (Not Really Trading)**
   - Buy and hold for years
   - Minimal active management
   - Lower stress but requires conviction
   - **Safest for most people**

## Before You Trade: Critical Prerequisites

### 1. Financial Stability

**DO NOT start trading if:**

- ❌ You have high-interest debt (credit cards, payday loans)
- ❌ You don't have 3-6 months emergency fund
- ❌ You need this money for rent, food, or bills
- ❌ You're trading to solve financial problems

**You're ready to start if:**

- ✅ All essential expenses are covered
- ✅ Emergency fund is established
- ✅ You have genuinely disposable income
- ✅ Losing 100% won't affect your lifestyle

### 2. Time Commitment

**Minimum time requirements:**

- **Learning phase:** 2-4 hours daily for 3+ months
- **Active trading:** 1-3 hours daily ongoing
- **Position monitoring:** 30 minutes daily minimum

If you can't commit this time, consider passive investing instead.

### 3. Emotional Readiness

Can you handle:

- Losing 30% of your investment in a day?
- Missing a 5x gain you almost took?
- Being wrong publicly if you share trades?
- Months of effort with no profits?

If no, that's honest. Trading might not be for you, and that's okay.

## Step 1: Education (Weeks 1-2)

### Understanding Cryptocurrency Basics

## Step 3: Paper Trading (Weeks 3-4 minimum)

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT skip paper trading. This is where you learn without losing real money.

### What is Paper Trading?

Simulated trading with fake money. You:

- Make all the same decisions
- Execute trades on paper
- Track results manually
- Learn from mistakes without cost

### How to Paper Trade

**Method 1: Manual Tracking (Recommended)**

```
1. Create a spreadsheet
2. Start with fake $10,000
3. "Buy" and "sell" at real prices
4. Track every trade with:
   - Entry date/time
   - Entry price
   - Position size
   - Reason for entry
   - Exit date/time
   - Exit price
   - Profit/loss
   - Emotions felt
   - Lessons learned
```

**Method 2: Exchange Demo Accounts**

- Bybit has testnet
- Some platforms offer paper trading
- Less educational than manual tracking
- Good for learning platform mechanics

### Paper Trading Goals

**Week 3-4 Objectives:**

- Execute 20+ trades
- Win or lose, learn from each
- Identify your emotional triggers
- Test different strategies
- Learn order types
- Understand fee impact

**Success Metrics:**

- NOT profitability (yet)
- Following a system consistently
- Cutting losses quickly
- Journaling every trade
- Staying disciplined

### Common Paper Trading Mistakes

❌ **Taking it less seriously** - "It's just fake money"

- Solution: Treat it like real money you'll lose

❌ **Taking huge risks** - "Let me try 50x leverage"

- Solution: Trade like you would with real money

❌ **Not tracking properly** - Sloppy records

- Solution: Detailed journal or no trade at all

❌ **Giving up after losses** - "This doesn't work"

- Solution: Losses are data, not failure

## Step 4: Your First Real Trade (Week 5+)

**Only proceed if:**

- ✅ Completed 20+ paper trades
- ✅ Have a written trading plan
- ✅ Can afford to lose 100% of deposit
- ✅ Understand basic technical analysis
- ✅ Set up security properly

### Starting Capital Recommendations

**Your Situation → Recommended Start**

- Student / Low income → $100-300
- Stable job / Middle income → $500-1,000
- High income → $1,000-3,000
- Very wealthy → $5,000-10,000

**Why start small:**

1. Real money emotions are different
2. Tuition to the market is inevitable
3. Prove yourself before scaling
4. Risk management practice

### Your First Trade Checklist

**Before clicking buy:**

- [ ] I have a written plan for this trade
- [ ] I know my exit price if I'm wrong
- [ ] I know my profit target
- [ ] Position size is 1-2% of capital
- [ ] I'm not emotional or impulsive
- [ ] I've checked the broader market
- [ ] I set my stop-loss order
- [ ] I'm okay losing this entire position

**After the trade:**

- [ ] Screenshot entry and reasoning
- [ ] Set alerts for key levels
- [ ] Stick to the plan (don't move stops)
- [ ] Journal the experience
- [ ] Learn regardless of outcome

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Going All-In

**What happens:** New trader puts 100% in one coin
**Result:** When it drops 30%, panic sells for big loss
**Solution:** Never risk more than 5% on one trade

### Mistake 2: FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

**What happens:** Coin pumps 50%, trader buys at top
**Result:** Immediate 20% loss, holds hoping for recovery
**Solution:** Wait for pullbacks, better entries always come

### Mistake 3: No Stop-Loss

**What happens:** "I'll just hold until it recovers"
**Result:** -10% becomes -50% becomes -80%
**Solution:** Always use stop-losses, protect capital

### Mistake 4: Revenge Trading

**What happens:** Loses money, immediately makes bigger trade to "win it back"
**Result:** Emotional decisions lead to bigger losses
**Solution:** Take a break after losses, follow the plan

### Mistake 5: Following Influencers Blindly

**What happens:** "Crypto guru" says buy, trader buys without research
**Result:** Guru already sold, trader holds the bag
**Solution:** Do your own research (DYOR), always

### Mistake 6: Trading Too Much

**What happens:** Makes 20 trades per day trying to catch every move
**Result:** Death by fees and bad decisions
**Solution:** Quality over quantity, wait for setups

### Mistake 7: Ignoring Fees

**What happens:** Makes many small trades, doesn't track fees
**Result:** "I'm profitable!" No, fees ate everything.
**Solution:** Calculate fees in every trade, they matter

## Mindset for Success

### The Professional Trader Mindset

**What losing traders think:**

- "I need to win this trade"
- "I can't take a loss"
- "I'll prove I'm right"
- "I need to trade more"

**What winning traders think:**

- "I need to follow my process"
- "Losses are business expenses"
- "Being wrong is data"
- "Waiting is part of the job"

### Your Daily Mantra

Read this before trading:

```
I am not here to be right.
I am here to make money.
I will protect my capital first.
I will follow my plan.
I will cut losses quickly.
I will let winners run.
I will learn from every trade.
I will be patient.
I will trade another day.
```

## Next Steps

Once you've completed this getting started phase:

1. **Review your first month results**
   - What worked?
   - What didn't?
   - Are you enjoying this?
   - Can you stay disciplined?

2. **Decide if you continue**
   - Honest assessment
   - Is this for you?
   - Do you have the temperament?

3. **If yes, proceed to:**
   - [Risk Management](./03-risk-management.md)
   - [Trading Psychology](./04-trading-psychology.md)
   - [Technical Analysis](./05-technical-analysis.md)

4. **If no, that's okay!**
   - Consider passive investing
   - HODLing quality projects
   - Learning about crypto without trading
   - There's no shame in this path

## Final Thoughts

Trading is a marathon, not a sprint. The goal of your first month isn't to get rich—it's to survive, learn, and decide if this path is for you.

**Remember:**

- 90% of traders lose money in the first year
- It takes years to become consistently profitable
- Protecting capital is more important than making money
- The best trade is often no trade

If you make it through the first month with capital intact and lessons learned, you're already ahead of most.

**Stay humble. Stay disciplined. Stay in the game.**
